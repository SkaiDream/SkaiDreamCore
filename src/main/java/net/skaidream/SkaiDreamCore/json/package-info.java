/**
 * JSON is a light-weight, language independent, data interchange format. See http://www.JSON.org/<br><br>
	The files in this package implement JSON encoders/decoders in Java.<br>
	It also includes the capability to convert between JSON and XML, HTTP
	headers, Cookies, and CDL.<br><br>
	
	This is a reference implementation. There is a large number of JSON packages
	in Java. Perhaps someday the Java community will standardize on one. Until
	then, choose carefully.<br><br>
	
	The license includes this restriction: "The software shall be used for good,
	not evil." If your conscience cannot live with that, then choose a different
	package.<br><br>
